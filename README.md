# Graviity Project

This project demonstrates gravity effects using HTML canvas. The code requires basic knowledge of HTML.

## Usage

1. Open your HTML file and add the following `<canvas>` tag within the `<body>` tag:

   ```html
   <body>
     <!-- Your existing content -->

     <canvas id="gravityCanvas"></canvas>

     <!-- Include the script file -->
     <script src="canvas.js"></script>
   </body>
   ```

2. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., canvas.js) and edit it for various effects and changes. Feel free to explore and experiment with different gravity-related code snippets.

3. Save your changes and open the HTML file in a web browser to see the gravity effects in action.
